Submission: Lab_06 COMP1510

I have submitted my entire project for this lab. Please note that, as per the lab submission objectives, you will only need to get/view four files. Those files are as follows:

1. Factorials.java
2. Guessing.java
3. Shop.java, Item.java
4. Candidate.java, VoteButtonPanel.java, VoteCounter.java, VoteCounterPanel.java

All the .class files for these above .java submissions are located in the "bin" folder.

Additional note:
For every example program I worked on, I created a package (appropriately named) for the files.

Step by step (do for all 4 above files):
1. Open Lab5 folder
2. Go to SRC folder
3. Open <<shoppingcart>> folder
4. the files in the folders: <<Shop.java>>, <<Item.java>>

5. up to packages folder
6. up to Lab5 folder
7. Go to Bin filder
3. Open <<shoppingcart>> folder
4. the files in the folders: <<Shop.class>>, <<Item.class>>
